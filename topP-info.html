        <h1>Understanding Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)</h1>
        <p><strong>Top-P</strong> (Nucleus Sampling) controls the diversity of the generated romantic narrative. It
            selects from the smallest set of most probable next words whose cumulative probability exceeds
            <code>P</code>, effectively shaping the "vocabulary palette" for the romantic prose.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Instead of considering all possible next words or a fixed number (like Top-K), Top-P dynamically adjusts the
            number of words considered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The model sorts possible next words by probability.</li>
            <li>It accumulates these probabilities until the sum is greater than or equal to <code>P</code>. This set
                forms the "nucleus."</li>
            <li>The model samples the next word only from this nucleus, influencing the range of expressions used in the
                romantic narrative.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if <code>topP = 0.9</code>, the model considers the most likely words that together make up 90%
            of the probability for the next word, filtering out very unlikely or potentially jarring terms for a
            romantic context.</p>

        <h2>Effect on Romantic Narrative Transformation</h2>
        <p>Top-P helps control the "focus" and "stylistic consistency" of the romantic narrative:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower Top-P (e.g., <code>0.8</code>):</strong>
                <p>The model favors more common romantic vocabulary and sentence structures. This ensures the narrative
                    remains stylistically consistent and avoids unexpected turns of phrase, leading to a more classic,
                    perhaps 'safer', romantic feel. For example, descriptions of a lover's eyes might consistently use
                    terms like "long lanh" (sparkling) or "biết nói" (expressive) rather than more unconventional
                    metaphors.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Higher Top-P (e.g., <code>0.95</code> - <code>1.0</code>):</strong>
                <p>The model explores a broader palette of words, potentially leading to more unique and imaginative
                    romantic descriptions. This can make the narrative feel fresher and more distinctive. For instance,
                    a lover's eyes might be described with less common but evocative imagery, like "sâu thẳm như đêm
                    huyền bí, ẩn chứa cả một trời nhung nhớ" (as deep as a mysterious night, holding a sky full of
                    longing), adding depth to the romantic portrayal.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Compared to Temperature (which reshapes probabilities), Top-P dynamically limits the *pool* of candidate
            words, ensuring they remain appropriate for a romantic tone.</p>

        <h2>Recommendation for This App</h2>
        <p>A Top-P value between <strong><code>0.9</code> and <code>0.95</code></strong> is a good starting point for
            romantic narratives. This allows for creativity in expression while maintaining thematic coherence and
            romantic elegance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you desire more daring or unconventional romantic prose with richer vocabulary, consider a slightly
                higher Top-P (e.g., <code>0.98</code>).</li>
            <li>If the narrative includes terms that feel out of place for a romance or too generic, try a slightly
                lower Top-P (e.g., <code>0.85</code>) to narrow the focus to more classic romantic expressions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adjust Top-P in conjunction with Temperature to fine-tune the narrative's blend of creativity and romantic
            style.</p>
