        <h1>Understanding Model Selection</h1>
        <p>This setting allows you to choose which Google Gemini model is used for the romantic narrative
            transformation. Different models possess distinct strengths in creative text generation, impacting the
            style, nuance, and quality of the resulting romantic prose.</p>

        <h2>Models Selectable in This Application</h2>
        <p>This application offers a curated selection of text generation models optimized for transforming raw text
            into elegant romantic narratives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17</code> (Gemini 2.5 Flash - Preview - Recommended):</strong>
                This is the default and highly recommended model for the Romantic Narrative Transformer. It's fast,
                versatile, and excels at creative text generation, making it ideal for transforming raw text into
                flowing, elegant romantic prose. Its balance of speed and quality is well-suited for achieving the
                desired literary flair and sophisticated language characteristic of classic romance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><code>gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17</code> (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite - Preview):</strong>
                This model offers a cost-efficient alternative while still supporting high throughput. It can be a good
                choice for transforming texts into romantic narratives, particularly if you're processing a large volume
                of text and are looking for similar efficiency to the standard Flash model. It may offer a slightly
                different stylistic nuance, providing another avenue for creative exploration in your romantic writing.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommendation for This App:</strong> For crafting captivating romantic narratives with this
                tool, <strong><code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17</code></strong> is the strongly recommended starting
                point. It's optimized for the kind of creative and stylistic transformation this app aims to achieve,
                balancing sophisticated language generation with performance to produce high-quality romantic prose.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Free Tier Considerations</h2>
        <p>The models available in this application are chosen with free-tier usage in mind, based on current Google
            Generative AI guidelines. The <code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17</code> model is generally available under
            the free tier, subject to Google's usage limits.</p>
        <p>It's important to be aware of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Limits:</strong> Free tiers often come with limitations on the number of requests you can
                make per minute or per day. If you exceed these limits, you might encounter errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Availability:</strong> Model names, availability, and their inclusion in free tiers can
                change over time as Google updates its offerings. The "preview" in a model name indicates it might be
                subject to changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Gemini Models (General Information)</h2>
        <p>The Gemini family includes a diverse range of models. While not all are selectable in this application to
            maintain focus on high-quality romantic narrative generation, here are examples of other
            text-input/text-output models in the broader Gemini ecosystem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>gemini-2.0-flash</code> and <code>gemini-2.0-flash-lite</code>: Part of the Gemini 2.0 series,
                also focused on speed and efficiency.</li>

                complex tasks.</li>
        </ul>

            application):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image generation (e.g., <code>imagen-3.0-generate-002</code>)</li>
            <li>Audio processing and generation</li>
            <li>Video understanding and generation</li>
            <li>Text embeddings</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This "Romantic Narrative Transformer" application is specifically designed for
