        <h1>Understanding Max Output Tokens</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Max Output Tokens</strong> parameter allows you to set an approximate upper limit on the length of the text generated by the model.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Models like Gemini process and generate text in units called "tokens." A token can be a word, part of a word, or punctuation. The <code>maxOutputTokens</code> setting tells the model to stop generating text once it has produced approximately that many tokens in its response.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a <strong>limit</strong>, not a target. The model might produce fewer tokens if it naturally concludes the thought or fulfills the prompt's request before reaching the limit.</li>
            <li>If the model is cut off mid-thought due to this limit, the output might seem abrupt or incomplete.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tokens vs. Words</h2>
        <p>The relationship between tokens and words isn't always one-to-one, especially in languages like Vietnamese which can have multi-syllable words or where word segmentation by the model might differ from human perception.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generally, for English, 1 token is roughly 0.75 words.</li>
            <li>For Vietnamese, this ratio might vary. A longer Vietnamese word might be multiple tokens.</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you set <code>maxOutputTokens: 100</code>, you might get around 60-80 Vietnamese words, but this is a rough estimate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Effect on Romantic Narrative Transformation</h2>
        <p>In the context of transforming text into a romantic narrative:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Value (e.g., <code>100</code> tokens):</strong>
                <p>Useful if you want a very concise summary or a brief romantic flourish. The narrative will be short.</p>
                <p><em>Example Idea:</em> If the input is a paragraph, a low token limit might result in just one or two highly romanticized sentences.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Medium Value (e.g., <code>500</code> tokens):</strong>
                <p>Could be suitable for transforming a short scene or a paragraph into a moderately descriptive romantic passage.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>High Value (e.g., <code>1000-2000</code> tokens):</strong>
                <p>Allows for more detailed and elaborate narratives, especially if the input text is longer. The model has more "space" to develop imagery, emotion, and plot points in a romantic style.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> The model also has an overall maximum token limit per turn (input prompt + output). If your input text is very long, the available tokens for the output will be less. The `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model has a large context window, but this is still a consideration.</p>

        <h2>Recommendation for This App</h2>
        <p>Start with a moderate value (e.g., <strong><code>500</code> to <code>1000</code> tokens</strong>) depending on the typical length of your input text.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the output feels too short or abruptly cut off, increase <code>maxOutputTokens</code>.</li>
            <li>If you consistently want shorter outputs, decrease it.</li>
            <li>Remember that the prompt itself guides the model to be a "flowing, romantic narrative." A very low token limit might conflict with this if the input requires more length to be transformed adequately.</li>
            <li>Setting it to 0 or leaving it unconfigured (as handled by the app if you set it to 0) typically means the model will decide the length based on the prompt and its internal limits, which can often be desirable.</li>
        </ul>
