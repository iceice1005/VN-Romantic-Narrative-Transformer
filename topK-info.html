        <h1>Understanding Top-K Sampling</h1>
        <p><strong>Top-K</strong> sampling limits the model's choices for the next word to the <code>K</code> most
            probable words. This influences the breadth of vocabulary used in the romantic narrative, from conventional
            to more diverse expressions.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>At each step of generating the romantic narrative:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The model identifies the <code>K</code> words with the highest probabilities.</li>
            <li>It then samples the next word only from this reduced set, further influenced by Temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If <code>topK = 1</code> (greedy decoding): The model always picks the single most likely word, leading
                to deterministic but potentially repetitive or clichéd romantic phrasing.</li>
            <li>If <code>topK = 50</code>: The model considers 50 probable words, allowing for a richer selection to
                craft the romantic narrative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Effect on Romantic Narrative Transformation</h2>
        <p>Top-K influences the diversity of language in your romantic transformation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Top-K (e.g., <code>5</code> - <code>10</code>):</strong>
                <p>The resulting narrative might lean heavily on common romantic tropes and vocabulary, as the model is
                    restricted to only the most immediately probable words. This can lead to a feeling of cliché if
                    overused, e.g., consistently describing love as "sét đánh" (love at first sight) or hearts as "rung
                    động" (trembling) without fresher alternatives.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Medium Top-K (e.g., <code>40</code> - <code>60</code>):</strong>
                <p>This offers a good balance for romantic writing. The model has enough choices to craft more nuanced
                    and varied descriptions of emotions and settings, moving beyond the most obvious phrases. It can
                    find more poetic ways to express affection or depict a romantic scene, for example, describing a
                    shared glance as "ánh mắt họ giao nhau, dệt nên một khoảnh khắc tĩnh lặng mà nồng nàn." (their eyes
                    met, weaving a moment of silence yet full of passion).</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>High Top-K (e.g., <code>100+</code>):</strong>
                <p>While offering the widest choice, its impact is often moderated by Top-P (if active and set lower).
                    If Top-P is also high, this setting gives Temperature more room to introduce diverse, sometimes
                    unexpected, romantic vocabulary. This could be beneficial for highly creative styles but might
                    require careful system instruction to ensure relevance and maintain the desired romantic tone.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Top-K can complement Top-P. While Top-P dynamically chooses the word pool based on cumulative probability,
            Top-K uses a fixed number, providing a different way to control vocabulary breadth.</p>

        <h2>Recommendation for This App</h2>
        <p>For transforming text into engaging romantic narratives, starting with Top-K around <strong><code>40</code>
                to <code>50</code></strong> is generally effective, especially when used alongside Top-P. The primary
            aim is to allow for rich, evocative language that avoids excessive repetition of common romantic phrases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the romantic output seems too constrained or uses very limited vocabulary, you might try increasing
                Top-K.</li>
            <li>However, many find that adjusting Temperature and Top-P has a more direct and intuitive impact on
                achieving the desired romantic "feel" and creativity. Focus on tuning those first.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Experiment with Top-K, but it might be a secondary parameter to tune after Temperature and Top-P for refining
            the romantic style.</p>
