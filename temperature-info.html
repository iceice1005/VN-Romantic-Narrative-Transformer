        <h1>Understanding Temperature</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Temperature</strong> parameter controls the randomness and creativity of the model's output. It
            influences how "imaginative" or "surprising" the generated romantic narrative will be.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>When generating text, the model assigns probabilities to possible next words. Temperature adjusts these
            probabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower Temperature (e.g., 0.1 - 0.5):</strong> Makes the output more deterministic and focused.
                The model is more likely to pick the most probable words, resulting in text that is often more
                predictable, consistent, and adheres to conventional romantic styles.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Temperature (e.g., 0.7 - 1.0):</strong> Makes the output more random and creative. The
                model is encouraged to consider less likely words, leading to more diverse, surprising, and potentially
                novel-sounding romantic prose. However, if too high, it can also lead to less coherent or overly florid
                output.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Effect on Romantic Narrative Transformation</h2>
        <p>In the context of transforming text into a romantic narrative:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Temperature (e.g., <code>0.3</code>):</strong>
                <p>The transformation will likely adhere to well-trodden paths of romantic expression, producing classic
                    but perhaps predictable prose. For instance, an input like "Họ yêu nhau" (They loved each other)
                    might become "Trái tim họ đã chung một nhịp đập, giản dị mà son sắt." (Their hearts beat as one,
                    simple yet faithful.) – reliable, but perhaps less imaginative.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Medium Temperature (e.g., <code>0.6</code> - <code>0.75</code>):</strong>
                <p>This often strikes the ideal chord for romantic narratives, allowing for graceful embellishments and
                    evocative language. The same "Họ yêu nhau" could blossom into "Tình yêu của họ tựa như một bản tình
                    ca du dương, với những nốt trầm bổng của nhớ thương và hy vọng, khơi gợi những rung động sâu thẳm
                    nhất." (Their love was like a melodious love song, with high and low notes of longing and hope,
                    evoking the deepest emotions.)</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>High Temperature (e.g., <code>0.9</code>):</strong>
                <p>The narrative might soar into highly poetic or metaphorical realms. "Họ yêu nhau" could become "Ái
                    tình đã giăng một sợi tơ vô hình, buộc chặt hai linh hồn họ vào một vũ điệu của đam mê dưới ánh
                    trăng huyền ảo, nơi mỗi cái chạm là một vần thơ." (Love had spun an invisible silk thread, binding
                    their two souls into a dance of passion under the mystical moonlight, where every touch was a verse
                    of poetry.) – potentially very unique, but could risk becoming overly ornate or less grounded if the
                    system instruction isn't strong.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommendation for This App</h2>
        <p>For crafting elegant romantic narratives, begin with a Temperature around <strong><code>0.6</code> to
                <code>0.75</code></strong>. This range usually fosters creativity and rich vocabulary suitable for
            romance. If the narrative feels too conventional, gently increase the temperature. If it becomes too
            abstract or loses coherence, a slight decrease is advisable. The goal is to find a balance that produces
            prose that is both enchanting and clear, capturing the essence of a classic romance novel.</p>
